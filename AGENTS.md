# Agent Build Rules

- React dashboard artifacts from `internal/dashboard/frontend/build` are embedded into the Go binary with `embed`.
- Never run `npm run dev` in production paths (`screpdb` default run or `screpdb dashboard`).
- Always use `make build` for local builds so UI assets are rebuilt before `go build`.
- CI/release workflows enforce UI build before Go build.
